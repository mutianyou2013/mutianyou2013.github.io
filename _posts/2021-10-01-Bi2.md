## Introduction

Electrochemical reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> has attracted researchers’ attention as it has the potential to utilize the abundant greenhouse gas in the Earth’s atmosphere and store intermittent energy from solar panels and wind turbines in chemical bonds. Many metals show activities in reducing CO<sub>2</sub> in aqueous phase. However, with the competition of the hydrogen evolution reaction, the selectivity is poor towards valued chemicals. Also, the high overpotential needed to drive the reactions causes low efficiencies that inhibits the practical applications.

## Current Knowledge and Focus

By using Bismuth (Bi) as catalysts and ionic liquids (ILs) as electrolytes under electrochemical conditions:
- CO<sub>2</sub> was reduced to CO instead of formate.- The CO<sub>2</sub> reduction overpotential was reduced.- The selectivity was enhanced since the HER was compressed. The underlying mechanism remains elusive due to the multi-step kinetics and the unclear interactions between ILs and key intermediates

- Exhibit an almost complete conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to CO (96.1 % FE<sub>CO</sub>), and a mass activity for CO evolution (MA<sub>CO</sub>) of 15.6 mA mg−1 at -2.0 V vs Ag/AgCl (~ 0.3 V overpotential).

- Compared with aqueous phase condition, free formation energies of key intermediates are lowered in non-aqueous phase, and CO is produced.

## Conclusions

- Constant potential calculations can capture selectivity trends from aqueous phase and IL non-aqueous phase.- By employing ILs as co-catalysts on Bi surfaces, thermodynamic barriers are reduced since the stabilization of *CO2 and *COOH by hydrogen bonding, and CO is obtained as the final product.
