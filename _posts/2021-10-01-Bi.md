## Introduction

Electrochemical reduction of CO2 has attracted researchers’ attention as it has the potential to utilize the abundant greenhouse gas in the Earth’s atmosphere and store intermittent energy from solar panels and wind turbines in chemical bonds. Many metals show activities in reducing CO2 in aqueous phase. However, with the competition of the hydrogen evolution reaction, the selectivity is poor towards valued chemicals. Also, the high overpotential needed to drive the reactions causes low efficiencies that inhibits the practical applications.

## Current Knowledge and Focus

By using Bismuth (Bi) as catalysts and ionic liquids (ILs) as electrolytes under electrochemical conditions:
- CO2 was reduced to CO instead of formate.- The CO2 reduction overpotential was reduced.- The selectivity was enhanced since the HER was compressed. The underlying mechanism remains elusive due to the multi-step kinetics and the unclear interactions between ILs and key intermediates 

## Computational Methods

- Zacros: a theoretical KMC package[1] - Lattice configuration: Cu(100) surface	- DFT calculated energetics of reaction steps - Adsorbate-adsorbate interactions can be included. - Kimocs: an atomistic KMC package[2] - Configuration: Cu(100) cube on surface	- Neural networks combined to calculate energy barriers

 Exhibit an almost complete conversion of CO2 to CO (96.1 % FECO), and a mass activity for CO evolution (MACO) of 15.6 mA mg−1 at -2.0 V vs Ag/AgCl (~ 0.3 V overpotential).

- KMC captures the trend of experimental CV curve.- It shows some differences compared to mean field approximation.

## Modeling Solid-Electrolyte Interfaces

- With applied potential at -0.5 V vs RHE - COads dominates the surface.- The surface has a small amount of Hads and H2Oads.

- Cu (100) cube collapsed as time advanced. - Bulk atoms decreased first then increased since moving to the subtrate.- Terrace atoms decreased while edge atoms increased since more terrace atoms formed edges. 

## Conclusions

- By considering adsorbate-adsorbate interactions, KMC model can better understand the mechanism of CO2  reduction.
- By employing artificial neural networks, the diffusion processes can be better simulated to help understanding the evolution of Cu surface.
