## Overview

The lattice convolutional neural network (LCNN) is a Python library for deep learning of lattice system developed by the Vlachos group at the University of Delaware and Jung group at KAIST. The model has been built in hope to improve upon cluster expansion methods, linear regression based on the clusters in the lattice. The LCNN performs better than the cluster expansion and cluster expansion based machine learning methods with sufficient number of data points.

I employed this LCNN to train the Cluster expansion model and then compare with the CE-TinNet model.
